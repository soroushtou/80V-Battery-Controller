# 80V-Battery-Controller
80V Battery Controller.


This system is used to manage an 80V battery. The battery powers a solar off-road. It is charged by solar panels on the top and by a Diesel Generator on the front. It consists of a power supply, an Arduino MEGA2560 controller, a relay board, a character LCD, and some buttons and LEDs.


The system starts charging the battery from a certain threshold with either the generator or the solar panel and stops when it is fully charged. I used C++ and ArduinoIDE for programming. The battery voltage, charge rate, and other parameters are shown on the character LCD. The system sends the data to Microsoft Excel, saves the data, and draws a live diagram.


Proteus simulation files are available.

Note: I wrote the program with CodeVisionAVR at first, but there were some malfunctioning, so I switched to ArduinoIDE. You can find the Codevision one in the Previous version folder.
